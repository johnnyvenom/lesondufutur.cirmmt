Transportation within the city includes the STM metro (subway) and bus service, public taxis, Uber, and [Bixi](https://bixi.com/en) - Montréal's city bike rental service.

The conference will be held at two venues, McGill University and the Université de Montréal. Both are easily accessible by public transit. See the [venues]({{< relref "../venues" >}}) page for more information.
