There are a wide variety of accommodations to choose from around Montréal. Given the two venues, we suggest choosing a hotel in the downtown corridor, which is nearby McGill University, and choosing public transportation or taxi to get to the Université de Montréal. 

### Recommended hotels

{{< figure src="cantlie.webp" caption="Hotel Le Cantlie Suites" >}}

Special rates are available at participating hotels as part of the [McGill Guest Program](https://www.mcgill.ca/accommodations/mohp/downtown). See the [website](https://www.mcgill.ca/accommodations/mohp/downtown) for a list of hotels and instructions on how to get the preferred rate. 


In particular, CIRMMT recommends the [Cantlie Suites](http://www.hotelcantlie.com/) and [Hotel 10](https://www.hotel10Montréal.com/), both of which are a short walk away from the McGill campus.
