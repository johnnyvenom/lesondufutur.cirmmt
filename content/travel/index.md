## Getting to Montréal

For attendees and participants arriving from out of town, Montréal is best reached by air, train or bus. 

<!-- ### Air  -->
{{< spoiler text = "Air" >}}

Montréal is serviced by the [Montréal-Trudeau International Airport](https://www.admtl.com/en) located in Dorval, about 30 minutes from downtown.  
There are several options for transportation between the airport and downtown: 

- public taxi
- Uber
- 747 express bus operated by the STM ([information](https://www.admtl.com/en/access/transports/buses-747-express))
- Hotels shuttle (check with your hotel)

<!-- ### Train  -->

{{< spoiler text = "Train" >}}

Trains from all major Canadian cities, as well as from New York and points south, arrive at [Gare Central (Central Station)](https://garecentrale.ca/en/) in downtown Montréal. It is located on the Bonaventure station of the Orange Line subway.

{{< spoiler text="Bus" >}}

Bus lines to and from several regional Canadian and U.S. cities operate from [Gare d'Autocars de Montréal](https://www.gamtl.com/en/bienvenue/), which connects to the Orange, Green and Yellow subway lines at the Berri-UQAM station.

## Travel within Montréal

Transportation options within the city include the STM [metro (subway)](https://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/metro) and [bus](https://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus) services, [public taxis](https://bonjour.taxi/en/), [Uber](https://www.uber.com/global/en/cities/montreal/), and [Bixi](https://bixi.com/en) - Montréal's city bike rental service.

{{< figure src="bixi.jpg" caption="Biki city bikes are a great way to get around Montréal in the summer." >}}

The conference will be held at two venues, McGill University and the Université de Montréal. Both are easily accessible by public transit. See the [venues]({{< relref "../venues" >}}) page for more information.

## Accommodations

{{< figure src="hotel10.jpeg" caption="Hotel 10" >}}

There are a wide variety of accommodations to choose from around Montréal. Given the two venues, we suggest choosing a hotel in the downtown corridor, which is nearby McGill University, and choosing public transportation or taxi to get to the Université de Montréal. 

### Recommended hotels

{{< figure src="cantlie.webp" caption="Hotel Le Cantlie Suites" >}}

Special rates are available at participating hotels as part of the [McGill Guest Program](https://www.mcgill.ca/accommodations/mohp/downtown). See the [website](https://www.mcgill.ca/accommodations/mohp/downtown) for a list of hotels and instructions on how to get the preferred rate. 


In particular, CIRMMT recommends the [Cantlie Suites](http://www.hotelcantlie.com/) and [Hotel 10](https://www.hotel10Montréal.com/), both of which are a short walk away from the McGill campus.
