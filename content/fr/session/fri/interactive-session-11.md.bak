## Description

Our conventional reality shall properly acknowledge the existence of online social networks comprising from millions to billions of active members. And even before fully understanding the sociological and psychological impacts of such massive remote social medias hosted interactions, we now face the potential migration of these individuals towards a new (virtual?) reality named Metaverse. Within such scenario, the interactive session is intended to discuss some insights on how existing AI algorithms featured in the social medias’ platforms (facial recognition, textual analysis, targeted advertising, language translation, news feed, etc.), as well Extended (augmented-virtual-mixed) Reality applications and environments may impact the future of Music and Music creation as we know.  

Such exciting and challenging matter will be addressed in a one hour and half discussion session featuring:  

- a 20 minutes presentation on AI / Metaverse / Music ecosystems intersections, aimed at setting the scene for a panel discussion.  
- a 30 minutes panel discussion featuring 4 panelists from the artistic domain, from the tech industry and from the Academia.  
- a 30 minutes interactive discussion with the participation of the audience.  
- a 10 minutes wrap up.  

The Interactive Session is expected to bring insights on some burning questions, such as:  

- What is the Metaverse?  
- Will the AI currently driving the social medias continue to thrive in the Metaverse?  
- How AI and the Metaverse are impacting the Sound & Music: which reality shapes which reality?
