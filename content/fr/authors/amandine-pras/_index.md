# About

Amandine Pras is leading the MA in Music Production at the University of York, UK. Since graduating from the Tonmeister program at the Paris Conservatoire, she has worked as a freelance audio engineer and record producer on projects ranging from free jazz, classical and popular music, through to electroacoustic and experimental music. Her PhD thesis (McGill/CIRMMT) focused on the varied practices of creating musical recordings in the digital era. Her last postdoctoral residency (New School for Social Research in New York) was an interdisciplinary, cross-cultural case study in West Bengal (India) with renown improvisers from the New York alternative jazz scene and from the Kolkata North-Indian classical music scene. Committed to find solutions to de-gender and de-colonize the field of audio, her current collaborations include the West African Audio Network in parallel to AFRINUM at Centre Georg Simmel, EHESS Paris; and AUDIO+ at the University of Victoria, BC.
