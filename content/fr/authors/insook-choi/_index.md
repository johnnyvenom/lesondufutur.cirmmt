# About

Insook Choi conceives her creative work as a contemporary composer, performer, and HCI researcher with new media forms engaging technology R&D. Her work is informed by cognitive and human sciences and grounded by her upbringing in a deep and abiding culture during a period of remarkable social change and community growth. Her compositions incorporate virtual reality, human movement studies, nonlinear narrative structures, simulation and modelling, AI methods and semantic reasoning, and prototyping media performance systems. Her works have been performed and exhibited in venues such as Dorsky Gallery Soho, ICMC, various Digital Expos, and the European Cultural Center in Venice during the Biennale. She publishes in creative technology journals, international conferences, and research editions across disciplines. 
 
Insook received the Doctor of Musical Arts from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a dissertation on her novel interface and HCI system architecture for real time performances with dynamical systems processing. Her academic posts include research scientist in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and in Human-Computer Intelligent Interaction at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Sciences and Technology at UIUC; visiting professor in the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and in NYUâ€™s Interactive Digital Media Institute; professor in the Graduate Center at City University of New York, and Associate Provost for Creative Technology at Columbia College Chicago. At CUNY, she designed and implemented an interdisciplinary degree program called Emerging Media Technologies, bridging design, engineering, and computing for new media. For the past six years, Insook served as a Professor of Interdisciplinary Arts and Technologies at University of Salford, Manchester UK. Due to the global pandemic, Insook left the UK and maintains her PhD supervisory role as a Visiting Professor. Currently, she is acting as a Chief Scientist for Wowsome XR, an international immersive media venture based in the UK.
