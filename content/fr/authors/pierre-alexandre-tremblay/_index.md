# About

Pierre Alexandre Tremblay (Montréal, 1975) is a composer with a keen interest for creative coding and a performer on bass guitar and sound processing devices, in solo and within various ensembles. Commissioned and performed worldwide, his chamber music is mainly released by the label Empreintes DIGITALes. He is a member of the London-based collective Loop.

He formally studied composition, bass guitar, analysis and studio production inx Montreal. He joined the University of Huddersfield in 2005, where he is now Professor of Composition and Improvisation, and leads the FluCoMa (Fluid Corpus Manipulation) project, funded by the EU’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. FluCoMa instigates new musical ways of exploiting ever-growing banks of sound and gestures within the digital composition process, by bringing breakthroughs of signal decomposition DSP and machine learning to the toolset of techno-fluent computer composers, creative coders and digital artists.
