## Title

- "Beyond cohabitation: towards a rich interdisciplinarity in music-technology research"

## Description

Too often, interdisciplinarity is considered a hurdle in a grant application, a box to tick. Even when the intention is genuine, rarely music technology projects go beyond one discipline servicing the other. What happens when we go candidly yet rigorously beyond cohabitation, from multi- to interdisciplinarity; from science-as-research to a plurality of research practices; from a service model to one that embraces the complex interrelation between disciplines across their porous barriers? Music technology research has a great potential to be truly interdisciplinary, not as add-on nor an in-between, but as a field in itself, a fluid third stream. Such endeavour is possible only if we go beyond a mere cohabitation of the parent disciplines, dissolving taxonomies, challenging epistemic commitments, towards hybridizing as a way to evolve. We hope to provoke a rich discussion during follow-up interactive sessions, in order to generate constructive ways forward for rich interdisciplinary music technology research projects.

This talk will propose a forum to go to the roots of the next big questions of our respective fields, and embrace the richness and complexities of their agonistic diversity. We hope to generate constructive ways forward for rich interdisciplinary music technology research projects.
