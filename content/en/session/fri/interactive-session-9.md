## Title

- Motion capture with inertial sensors for ecological application

## Presenter

## Description

The purpose of this session is to propose an analysis of the specificity of capturing movement in ecological situations. Indeed, the ecological situation of being a real situation differs from the situation in the laboratory due to an uncontrolled environment and a measure which does not follow a specific experimental protocol. Due to these specificities,  the conventional techniques of motion capture with optical systems and markers are no longer suitable. The alternative lies in the use of inertial sensors also called IMU. However, it does not provide the same type of movement measurements that it will have to be taken into account for the analysis of the movement. To illustrate this, this interactive session will be punctuated by two practical applications of inertial sensors.
