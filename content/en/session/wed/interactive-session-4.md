## Title

- Audiovisual immersion in the heart of the musical performance: two interactive experiences in virtual reality with the world music ensembles Kora Flamenca and Levantine Rhapsody 


## Overview

The objective of this interdisciplinary project is to develop an innovative methodology for the immersive capture of musical performance, using virtual reality technologies - 360-degree stereoscopic image capture and ambisonic digital audio capture - to then make the musical experience accessible in an immersive and interactive audiovisual format, allowing the listener-spectator to immerse himself in the heart of the performance. With the support of the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the OICRM, two virtual reality experiences have been created in collaboration with the World Musicians Centre and two leading ensembles of the Montreal world music scene, the Kora Flamenca quartet (kora, double bass, flamenco guitar, cajon), as well as the Levantine Rhapsody quintet (kanun, violin, flutes, percussions, cello).

These two experiences will be accessible to workshop participants through Oculus Quest 2 headsets, while members of the team will be present to present and discuss the specificities of this pilot project and its repercussions, both for musical ethnography and for the mediation of music and the analysis of orchestration in an instrumental performance situation.
