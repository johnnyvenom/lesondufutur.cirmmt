## Description

With the help of the audience, we plan an open-ended tour of how music is grounded in (and integrates with) the human brain and body. Our participants will first give brief presentations on topics ranging from how pianists plan and execute motor strategies, eye-hand synchronization in xylophone playing, music sensed through bionic ears, music and rhythm as interventional tools, new toys for music researchers, and the interaction of the physiological and social aspects of music. This will be followed by a free-wheeling, thought/action-provoking and hopefully inspiring discussion session: please bring along your questions, thoughts, ideas, and demos.
