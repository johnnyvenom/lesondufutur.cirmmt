The Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology (CIRMMT) is organizing its first international conference, Le son du futur/Le futur du son, to take place in Montréal, May 24-27, 2022. The conference format will be different from usual settings and designed to foster exchanges and interaction among researchers and creators through several different types of sessions. Keynotes will be delivered by guests representing the artistic, scientific, and industrial sectors to provide cutting edge information, while three concerts will display some of the artistic outputs of CIRMMT research-creation activities. 

Composed of 1 student symposium ([COBS]({{< relref "/cobs" >}}) on Tuesday), 4 panel sessions, 5 keynotes, 2 poster sessions, 11 interactive sessions, 3 roundtables, 2 workshops and 3 concerts, the 4-day conference will aim to foster collaborative projects through a creative approach. In lieu of a traditional setting where research is exclusively presented through lectures or poster sessions, our conference will privilege collective activities and work/interaction sessions following dense moments of knowledge sharing.
