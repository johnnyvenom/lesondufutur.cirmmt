# About

Douglas Eck is a Principal Scientist at Google Research and a research director on the [Brain Team](https://research.google/teams/brain/). His group is active in a wide range of topics including

- Fundamental Learning Algorithms
- Language and Multi-Modal (including [T5](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer))
- Reinforcement Learning
- Computer Vision, Imagery, Video
- Generative Models, including [Magenta](https://g.co/magenta) for music and art
- HCI & User-in-the loop, in collaboration with the [PAIR](https://pair.withgoogle.com/) team 

<!-- His own research lies at the intersection of machine learning and human-computer interaction (HCI). Doug created [Magenta](https://g.co/magenta), an ongoing research project exploring the role of machine learning in the process of creating art and music. He is also an advocate for [PAIR](https://pair.withgoogle.com/), a multidisciplinary team that explores the human side of AI through fundamental research, building tools, creating design frameworks, and working with diverse communities. Doug is active in many areas of basic machine learning research, including natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the past, Doug worked on music perception, aspects of music performance, machine learning for large audio datasets and music recommendation. He completed his PhD in Computer Science and Cognitive Science at Indiana University in 2000 and went on to a postdoctoral fellowship with Juergen Schmidhuber at [IDSIA](http://www.idsia.ch/) in Lugano Switzerland. Before joining Google in 2010, Doug was faculty in Computer Science in the University of Montreal machine learning group (now [MILA machine learning lab](https://mila.quebec/en/)) where he became Associate Professor.
