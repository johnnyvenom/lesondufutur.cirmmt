# About

Prof. Voix leads the NSERC-EERS Industrial Research Chair in In-Ear Technologies (CRITIAS) for the development of leading-edge technology combining in-ear instrumented hardware platforms with audio signal processing and biosignal extraction algorithms to enable its Canadian industrial partner, EERS Global Technologies Inc., to commercialize in-ear wearables for hearing protection, hearing aid, two-way communication and brain-computer interfaces for industrial, military, consumer and medical markets. CRITIAS core research activities will include 3 areas of expertise: a) digital hearing protection, b) communication in noise and c) in-ear sensing. He also carries a separate line of research on human earcanal characterization towards a long-term project of micro-energy harvesting for in-ear wearables.
