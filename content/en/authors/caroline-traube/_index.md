# About

Caroline Traube is an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Music of the Université de Montréal where she teaches and conducts research in the fields of music acoustics, psychoacoustics and the study of musical performance. She holds degrees in music technology (Ph.D., McGill U.) and in electrical engineering and telecommunications (Eng., CCRMA/U. Stanford, USA; Ir. Faculté polytechnique de Mons, Belgium), she has also studied piano and electroacoustic composition. Caroline Traube directs the Laboratoire de recherche sur le geste musicien (LRGM) whose mission is to support the interdisciplinary study of musical practices, in particular performance, as well as the transfer of knowledge between the scientific and artistic communities. Her research, which focuses on musical expression and the interaction between musicians and their instruments from biomechanical, acoustic and perceptual points of view, is in the field of experimental musicology and is situated at the intersection of the spheres of activity of the CIRMMT, OICRM and BRAMS groups of which she is a regular member. Her current research focuses on the phenomenon of multimodal production and perception of instrumental timbre as well as on orchestration and its realization by performers, in the context of the ACTOR (Analysis, Creation and Teaching of ORchestation) research partnership.
