# About

Michael Schutz is Professor of Music Cognition/Percussion at McMaster University in Canada. Designated “University Scholar” in recognition of his work bridging music perception and performance, he directs the percussion ensemble and teaches courses on music perception and cognition. Active in the promotion of new music, Michael premiered internationally renowned composer Judith Shatin's trio Time To Burn, and subsequently recorded this piece on a release from Innova Recordings. Since 2013 he has served on the percussion faculty of the Penn State Honors Music Institute. Drawing on his interdisciplinary training in music, psychology, and computer science, he directs the [MAPLE Lab](www.maplelab.net) researching Music, Acoustics, Perception, and LEarning, which has secured over $2 million in external funding from SSHRC, NSERC, CFI, and the National Institutes of Health. Michael was honoured with the 2019 Alumni Award from the Penn State School of Music, and is an artist/endorser for Innovative Percussion and Sabian Cymbals.
