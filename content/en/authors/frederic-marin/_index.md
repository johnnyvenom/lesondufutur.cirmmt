# About

Since 2009, Frédéric Marin is Professor in the Laboratory for Biomechanics and Biomechanical Engineering at the University of Technology of Compiegne (UTC), France. He received the Ph.D. degree from Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts et Métiers of Paris, France, in mechanical engineering related to biomechanics in 2000. After working in industry, he joined the Institute of Orthopaedic Research and Biomechanics, Medical University of Ulm, Germany, as a researcher. In 2004 he became associate professor at UTC and in 2007 he received his Habilitation diploma based on his research of the kinematic analysis of human joints. His main research interests are centred on the movement biomechanics and he is the initiator of  the creation of  the Center of Excellence in Motion Biomechanics of human and animal (CoEMoB) at UTC.
