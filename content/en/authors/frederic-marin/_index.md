# About

Researcher at the Biomechanics and Bioengineering Laboratory (BMBI) of the UTC, Frédéric Marin explores the biomechanics of human body movements. On the clinical side, he aims to optimize the functional evaluation of patients. He works on the biomechanics of the face, in particular the functional recovery after a facial paralysis or after a face transplantation. In ergonomics, the researcher studies, among other things, the movements that can be a source or consequence of musculoskeletal disorders, contributing to the design of a haptic glove that allows the assembly of virtual parts of a digital model. His third area of investigation: movement as a cultural vector. Alongside ethnomusicologists, he measures the gestures of expert and non-expert musicians from different ethno-cultural groups and observes the variations between them, in order to better understand what differentiates virtuosos from others and how their playing (e.g., the way they place their fingers on the instrument) can vary according to culture.
