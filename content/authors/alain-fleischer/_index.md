# About

Alain Fleischer was born in Paris in 1944.

After studying literature, linguistics, semiology and anthropology at the Sorbonne and at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, he taught at the Université de Paris III, the Université du Québec à Montréal, and a number of art, photography and film schools (including IDHEC/FEMIS in Paris). Winner of the Prix de Rome, he was a resident at the Villa Medici from 1985 to 1987. He was tasked by the French Culture Ministry with conceiving Le Fresnoy – Studio National des Arts Contemporains, which he now directs.
