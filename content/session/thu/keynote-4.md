## Title

- "Breaking the Brain to Sound Barrier: Leveraging the Mind-Body Continuum for Musical Expression"

## Description

Working with the idea that the mind and body form a continuum of thought to control that learns to incorporate biomechanics and environmental constraints with perceptual ones to achieve players goals, we are looking for ways to create new adaptive mechanisms for New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIMEs) that help to reduce information demands on players while at the same time increasing information throughput for more expressive interfaces. Iâ€™ll present some of efforts towards brain to speech interfaces as well as some abstract work that explores how we can build adaptive NIMEs.
